After you download the project go into the client app in the folder SquadronClient and run 'NPM I' (install)
for this you will need to have node js version 14+ 'https://nodejs.org/en/download/' here is download link if need it.
When download ends for node packages (node_modules) ends in the same root file pres NG S or Ng serve, the application will run on default port 'http://localhost:4200/'.
This will lunch the client APP.

You can open the backend application with visual studio 2022 download link if need it is 'https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/'
NOTE! use the community version its free min ver requred is Version 17.2, after that  
from folder SquadronServer and click on SquadronServer.sln file
and press the green play button Squadron.Api the application will run it self with swagger as default UI and it will create database and seed default user
User credentials are
Email: 'SquadronAdmin@live.com'
Password: 'Pa$$w0rd'
Or you can register your own user from the angular client or swagger Ui.

testing files are provided in the solution under folder Testing Files to palay around.

Good luck :)
